## How to build the addon from source

* Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:pabuisson/in-my-pocket.git`
* `cd` to the directory where you cloned the repository,
* `$ npm install`: install the dependencies needed to build the addon from the source files. You'll need to have `npm` installed on your computer. For more information about this, see [npmjs.com - Get npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm),
* `$ npm run build`: launch esbuild and store all the final files into `./build`. In there, you'll find a `esbuild/` directory which can be loaded in Firefox through the `about:debugging` page for development purpose,
* `$ npm run watch`: launch esbuild in watch mode, building the concatenated files into `./build ` and updating the build everytime you modify the source files. See above for details about the generated `build/` directory,
* `$ npm run package` : compiles the source files and build the addon "zip" files, ready for submission to the browser stores :) This task triggers a different subtask, `$ npm run package-firefox`
* `$ npm run test`: runs the tests associated to this project.
* `$ npm run test-watch`: runs the tests associated to this project, and re-run the relevant test files when code is modified.


## Linter

If you want to, `eslint` is configured and can help you in the development process. You'll need to set it up with `npm install -g eslint` and then setup your text editor of choice so that it's able to display the linter warnings.

`prettier` is also configured, you can run it to have your JS code correctly formatted. There is no git hook yet to enforce it, but it will happen someday soon.


## Workflow

Before submitting a pull request, please always make sure that it starts from the latest `origin/master` available (if you fetched the project long ago, you might not have the latest version). If it's not the case, please do not forget to rebase your branch on `origin/master` first (you'll need to merge `origin/master` in your own `master` branch).

# firefox-pocket

For all those who are missing the old Pocket addon for Firefox, here's an unofficial client for the [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) webservice. I'm not in any way affiliated to Pocket and only does this for my fellow Firefox users looking for an easy to use Pocket extension for their favorite browser.

If you have suggestions on how to improve this extension or encounter some bugs, do not hesitate to contact me on Twitter @pabuisson. And of course, if you like this extension, do not forget to leave a comment on [Mozilla addons](http://https://addons.mozilla.org/), it will be greatly appreciated!

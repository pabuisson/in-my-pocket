This project is aimed to all people who are missing the old Pocket addon for Firefox. It is an unofficial browser addon for the [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) webservice, for the moment targeting only Firefox > 45. I'm not in any way affiliated to Pocket and only does this for my fellow Firefox users looking for an easy to use Pocket extension for their favorite browser.
